Leaving Word Processors Behind
------------------------------

What is it?
 - some stuff I've collected to help writers migrate away from using word
   processors and toward using text editors, such as FocusWriter

What does it do?
 - It will walk over a directory heirarchy and dump every .odt file therein
   to .txt in MarkDown syntax.
 - Eventually it should also do RTF and other document formats supported by
   OpenOffice.  Even more eventually, it should do formats supported by 
   AbiWord or other scriptable open source word processors too.
 - Eventually it should have Nautilus menu items to let you right-click on a 
   file and dump it.

Why do I want it?
 - I don't know.  Maybe you don't.  But I did, so I cobbled together the 
   pieces and I didn't want to lose my work so I put it in this repository.
   Here you go.

Can I use it?
 - I really don't see why not.  Good luck.

Who do I have to thank?
 - Probably Aaron Swartz, John Gruber, and Yuri Takhteyev.  I haven't really
   done anything (yet).
